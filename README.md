An `alt+space` launcher for Windows, built with Electron.

I always dreamed of an alternative to Alfred on Windows, that is made with JavaScript.
so, I made it.

## Vision

It's a launcher with strict syntax (like terminal programs), it's not targeting to interpret natrual language.  
I believe the strict syntax can provide more powerful and fast response than to interpret natural language.

## Features

* Searching Executable files very fast with Fuzzy Matching
* Plugins in Pure JavaScript
